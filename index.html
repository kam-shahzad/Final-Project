        <p>In Syracuse, NY, a close examination of 3rd grade English Language Arts (ELA) proficiency levels showcases inequalities linked to poverty rates. Syracuse, NY, is a city with significant poverty challenges. This high poverty rate has extensive effects for educational outcomes, particularly in early grades where foundational skills in literacy are developed. </p>

        <p>Factor such as limited educational resources and the overall environment combine to create disparities in academic achievement. The New York State Education Department (NYSED) provides a detailed picture of student performance, including proficiency levels in English Language Arts (ELA). </p>

        <p>For the 2022-2023 academic year, the data for Syracuse indicates a concerning trend. According to NYSED, the percentage of third graders meeting or exceeding the proficiency level in ELA is notably low in Syracuse. Students from low-income families often face a range of challenges that can hinder their educational progress. Over the past three years, the data from Syracuse, NY, shows poverty rates being increased, while the proficiency levels of 3rd graders in English Language Arts (ELA) have continued to decline. This relationship highlights the growing educational disparities worsened by economic challenges and emphasizes the urgent need for new programs. </p>

        <p>One of the most significant challenges is limited access to educational resources such as books, technology, and learning materials. This lack of access can be especially detrimental to English Language Learners (ELL), who already face additional hurdles in acquiring literacy skills. Rachel Weimer, a local English as a native language (ENL) teacher, in Syracuse attests to the lack of resources for students who do test lower on the State standardized English Language Arts Proficiency test. “There are definitely less resources for the students with socio-economic disadvantages compared to kids in the suburbs,” she said. For students from low-income families, the scarcity of these resources can hinder their academic progress. </p>

        <p>Without access to a variety of reading materials and technological tools, students may struggle to build the vocabulary and comprehension skills necessary for literacy development. For ELS students, who are learning English as a second language, the impact of limited resources is even more pronounced. ELS students require targeted support to develop proficiency in English, and without adequate resources, their progress can be significantly slowed. These students benefit from interactive and diverse learning materials that cater to different learning styles and help them grasp the nuances of the English language. </p>

        <p>In Syracuse, the demographic composition of ELL students reflects broader trends related to socioeconomic challenges. Approximately 94% of economically disadvantaged students in Syracuse are enrolled in ELL programs. This statistic emphasizes the connection of poverty and language barriers, highlighting the fact that many students facing economic hardship are also struggling with learning English. 35% of ELL students are African American and 28% are Hispanic.</p>

        <p>Approximately 75 % of 3rd graders in Syracuse, which equates to about 191 students, are enrolled in ELL programs. This substantial number of ELL students highlights the need for tailored educational programs. The majority of these students speak English as a second language, which necessitates specific instructional strategies designed to address their unique needs. Effective ELL programs must provide not only language instruction but also support in developing literacy skills in English. </p>

        <p>However, Weimer shares from experience that most immigrant students who test proficient outperform their American born peers in their academic career. According to NYSED, there are around 1,523 new ELL students and 853 currently enrolled and developing ELL students. </p>
    
        <p>The schools must continue these programs providing specialized classes to students who need it. By addressing the complex needs of ELL students, particularly those from low-income backgrounds, it is possible to improve literacy outcomes and support their overall academic success in this city. Ensuring reasonable access to educational resources and targeted English classes/programs is crucial in helping these students overcome the barriers they face and achieve their full potential.</p>
